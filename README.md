# 🎯 Python Number Guessing Game

A simple command-line number guessing game built with Python.  
The program randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.  

This project is a part of my **Python learning journey**, where I practice writing interactive programs and working with loops, conditionals, and random number generation.
